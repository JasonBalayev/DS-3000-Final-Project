        "Introduction: I was talking to my India last month and the topic of air quality got mentioned. Thats when he mentioned that breathing in the air in Delhi daily is the equivalence of smoking 50 cigarettes a day. This seemed like an exaggeration or outright lie which to my horror wasn't. Air pollution in urban areas aren't a joke and are often overlooked. Many people might see a major modern city such as New York City and overlook air pollution such as smog. However, the more I research into this topic, the more I realize that pollution in major cities are too overlooked. I was reading the news earlier this year and also saw this headline of a Stanford professor. He had kids and didn't even smoke, however was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. With his non-smoking lifestyle and while even teaching medicine, he would be the last person you'd expect to be diagnosed with lung cancer. This was a story that really woke me up to the affects of air pollution. If a non-smoking man can get lung cancer from air pollution, the air is only going to be more harmful to smokers and people with incrased liklihood of cancers. I aim to use data science to see how we can observe trends in air pollution. These questions answered can be used to help advocate and show others how dangerous and important air quality actually is.\n",
